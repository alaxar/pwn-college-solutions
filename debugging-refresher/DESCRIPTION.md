A critical part of working with computing is understanding what goes wrong when something inevitably does.
This module will build on your prior exposure to GDB with some more _debugging_ of programs: digging in, poking around, and gaining knowledge.
This is one of the most critical skills that you will learn in your computing journey, and this module will hopefully help water the seed that we planted before.

As you know, GDB is a very powerful dynamic analysis tool which you can use in order to understand the state of a program throughout its execution.
You will become more familiar with some of its capabilities in this module.

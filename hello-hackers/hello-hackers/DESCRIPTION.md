Okay, we have one thing left for this run of challenges.
You've written out a single byte, and now we'll practice writing out multiple bytes.
I've stored a 14-character secret string at memory location `1337000`.
Can you write it out?

**Hint:**
The *only* thing you should have to change compared to your previous solution is the value in `rdx`!
